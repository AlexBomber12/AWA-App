# CI Triage

## Failing workflows
- **CI** workflow (compose-health job)
- **test** workflow (health-checks job)

## Summary
Docker compose health checks failed because the Redis service exited immediately. The startup command attempted to run `sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=1`, which is not permitted in the execution environment, so `redis-server` never started and downstream services reported the container as unhealthy.

## Fix
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to ignore failures from the `sysctl` command so the Redis server starts even when kernel parameters cannot be modified.

## Logs

- `ci-logs/latest/test/health-checks/5_Run export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1.txt`
