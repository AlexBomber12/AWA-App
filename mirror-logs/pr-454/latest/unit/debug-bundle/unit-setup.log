ERROR: Cannot install black==24.8.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested black==24.8.0
    The user requested (constraint) black==25.9.0

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    black

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
