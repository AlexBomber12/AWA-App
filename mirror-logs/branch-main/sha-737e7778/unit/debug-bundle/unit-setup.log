ERROR: Cannot install psycopg==3.2.9 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested psycopg==3.2.9
    The user requested (constraint) psycopg==3.2.11

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
