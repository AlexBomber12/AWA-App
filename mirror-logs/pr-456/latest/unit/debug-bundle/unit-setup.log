ERROR: Cannot install fastapi==0.116.1 and fastapi==0.120.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested fastapi==0.120.1
    The user requested fastapi==0.116.1
    The user requested (constraint) fastapi==0.120.1

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    fastapi

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
